# Pros and cons of using markdown as a documentation language

## Pros

- *Easy*: Markdown is a pretty easy language to learn and it is lightweight
- *Works with git*: Since it’s plain text, it’s easy to track changes and manage with version control.
- *Supported everywhere*: Most tools and editors understand markdown, so it’s versatile.
- *Readable as-is*: Raw files are pretty easy to follow without previewing.
- *Keeps things simple*: It helps you focus on content instead of formatting.

## Cons

- *Limited formatting*: It can be tricky if you need advanced layout or styling options. I usually end up including some HTML/CSS for tables/nested content.
- *Inconsistent across tools*: Different platforms support slightly different flavors of Markdown.
- *Needs a build setup*: To turn Markdown into a polished site, you usually need extra tools like static site generators.

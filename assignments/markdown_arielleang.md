# A Technical Writer's Guide to Markdown

On this page, we discuss the basics of Markdown, a popular, lightweight markup language used to format text. 
We will cover its advantages and limitations as it relates to technical writing, as well as some tips and tricks to optimize using Markdown for your documentation.

Before we begin, take a look at GitHub's [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a quick refresher on the most common syntax people use in Markdown.

## Advantages

### 1. Docs-as-code

If your company practices docs-as-code or is considering implementing it, then knowing Markdown would be a great advantage to the technical writing team.
Most developer tools use text editors to write code, so writing documentation in Markdown would integrate into the development process well.

### 2. Simplicity of tools

Markdown uses plain-text editors, so it would be very easy (and affordable) to find a program to write documentation in. 
In addition, it's also simpler to keep formatting standards consistent once a specific variant of Markdown is established for documentation.

## Limitations

### 1. Lack of styling options

The downside of Markdown being such a lightweight markup language is that there are very few options for formatting. 
You can incorporate HTML and CSS or other content management systems to handle more complicated styling, but it might defeat the purpose of using Markdown at all. 

### 2. Learning curve

Even though Markdown is a simple language, new writers who are unfamiliar with it might struggle initially as they learn and get accustomed to it. 
There might also be a technological roadblock if your company practices docs-as-code, and the tools that developers use require more expertise than just using an editor.

## Tips and Tricks

### 1. Create a basic syntax reference guide

Your technical writing team can create a simple Markdown reference guide that contains basic syntax, or you can customize the guide to feature the specific notations that are commonly used in your product's documentation.

For example, you can create a table that outlines the desired formatting, its Markdown syntax, and the rendered output:

| Formatting        | Syntax           | Rendered Output  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| Italics     | This `*word*` is italicized. | This *word* is italicized. |
| Bold     | This `**word**` is bolded. | This **word** is bolded. |
| Strikethrough | This `~~word~~` is struck through. | This ~~word~~ is struck through. |

### 2. Always preview your work

While most plain-text editors can be used for Markdown, I would recommend finding one that has a preview feature such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
Not only does previewing your work ensure that your code outputs what you intend to visually, you can also use it to check for any coding errors such as wrong links or missing end brackets.

### 3. Don't be afraid to ask for help

We are writers first and foremost, and any company or team with a great working culture will understand that and gladly support our more technical endeavors. 
If you get stuck on a piece of code, or if using a tool starts getting frustrating, reach out to SMEs, developers, or even your own teammates for assistance. 
Within your team and company, you're all working on the same product and want it to be excellent, and excellent products come with great documentation!

# Advantages of Markdown
 
**1. Simplicity and Readability**

   - **Advantage:** Markdown is easy to learn and read in raw form. Even non-technical stakeholders can contribute with a minimal learning curve.
   - **Use Case:** Lightweight documentation, such as README files and inline comments, is ideal.
   - **Example:**

     # Heading 1
     
     ## Heading 2
  
**2. Portability**

- **Advantage:** Markdown files (.md) are plain text, so they work on any system and integrate easily with version control like Git.
- **Use Case:** Works well with CI/CD pipelines and static site generators, such as MkDocs, Docusaurus, and Jekyll.

**3. Readable and Clean** 

- **Advantage:** The raw source is readable even without rendering
- **Use Case:** *This Text is Italicized*, and **This Text is Bold**.
  
**4. Widely Supported**

- **Advantage:** Used by platforms like GitHub, ReadMe, and Stack Overflow. GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM) extends standard Markdown with useful extras like tables and task lists.
 
# Limitations of Markdown

**1. Lack of Advanced Layout Options**

- **Disadvantage:** Markdown doesn't support complex layouts (e.g., columns, advanced styling) without HTML fallback.
  
**2. Inconsistent Rendering**

- **Disadvantage:** Markdown rendering can vary across tools (e.g., GitHub vs. Bitbucket).
- **Tip:** Always preview your markdown on the target platform.

**3. Limited Interactivity**

- **Disadvantage:** You canâ€™t include JavaScript or advanced logic in Markdown, making it less dynamic than HTML or documentation generators.

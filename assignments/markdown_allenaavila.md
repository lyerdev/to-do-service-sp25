# Get Started with Markdown as a New Writer

## Context

Read this markdown file for a quick overview on using markdown for documentation as a technical writer. 

## What is markdown? 

According to this [resource](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github "Quickstart for writing on GitHub"):
> Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text. You can use Markdown syntax, along with some additional HTML tags, to format your writing on GitHub, in places like repository READMEs and comments on pull requests and issues.

## Advantages of markdown 

* No matter where you're starting from, it's likely that you'll be able to use markdown after a quick review of instructional details.
* Because the syntax is simple, you can focus on the content, rather than the learning curve a new language.
* You can achieve a variety of useful formats for your documentation.

### Here are some examples of the things you can achieve with markdown: 

*Italicized text style* looks like `*Italicized text style*` in markdown.

**Bold text style** looks like `**Bold text style**` in markdown.

**_Combined italicized and bold text style_** looks like `**_Combined italicized and bold text style_**` in markdown.

~~Strike-through text style~~ looks like `~~Strike-through text style~~` in markdown.

## Limitations of markdown

While markdown's simplicity lends it numerous advantages, it also leads to some limitations for documentation complex topics that require a more sophisticated approach. 
### Tables

Tables, for instance, don't seem very straightforward in markdown. I copied this example of a table from the cheatsheet because writing it by hand seemed like a timely task:
| Column A |Column B  |
|-----:|---------------|
|     Row 1A|       Row 1B        |
|     Row 2A|      Row 2B         |
|     Row 3A|          Row 3B     |

I can imagine that if you'd need a slightly more complicated table, creating that table in markdown would be difficult. 

### Images

Pictures also don't seem very intuitive to add in markdown. However, [there is a method to add them](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images). For example:

Displaying this image of the moon:

uses this Markdown to add it to the page.

## Advice to get started

You can:
1. Conduct research about markdown to better understand it by reading articles or guides. Example: [Introduction to Markdown](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/markdown/). 
2. Bookmark a markdown cheatsheet like [this one](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for easy reference.
3. Practice writing in markdown before tackling a documentation assignment, such as [this tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

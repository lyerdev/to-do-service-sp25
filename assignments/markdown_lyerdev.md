# Pros and Cons of Markdown

This topic focuses on specifically addressing any functional pros or cons of Markdown, along with a demonstration of various Markdown features throughout. 

## The Pros

Markdown's freedom of formatting is unrivaled by comparable content management systems (CMS), providing any desired formatting in its core components.
By adding **bold** and _italicized_ formatting with Markdown, there should be no concerns of import errors upon pulling these resources into a publishing tool designed to ingest the notation.

### Additional positives of Markdown

1. In-topic linking without the need of a related links table
2. Inline image support
3. This example from GitHub's [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) shows code blocks and syntax highlighting.:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

## The Cons

By working in Markdown, you limit yourself to the bare essentials of documentation.
The base functionality of formatting and configuration in Markdown doesn't have any room for expansion.
This leaves writers with a limited scope of tools to use and forces documentation written in Markdown to be simple and uninteresting.

### Additional negatives of Markdown

1. Lack of document control and reuse
2. Difficult to create a information architecture

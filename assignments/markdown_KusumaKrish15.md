# Markdown advantages and limitations
Let's talk about advantages and limitations of using one of the world's most popular markup languages, Markdown. 

## Advantages of Markdown
1. **Simplicity**: Markdown's syntax is easy to learn and use.
2. **Readability**: Markdown is easy to read even without rendering.
3. **Flexibility**: Markdown can be converted to HTML and other formats.
   
## Limitations of Markdown
- _**Limited styling options**_: Markdown doesn't support advanced formatting and styling.
- _**No WYSIWYG editing**_: Unlike rich text editors, Markdown requires you to write and then preview.
  
## Advice to help a new writer
1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic formatting and then to explore more complex features.
2. **Use a Markdown editor**: Tools like Typora or VS Code with Markdown extensions can help.
3. **Practice consistently**: The more you use Markdown, the more easy and intuitive it becomes.
4. **Reference documentation**: Use [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) as a handy reference.

### A tip to create tables in Markdown
Tables are created using pipes | and dashes -. For example:
| Syntax | Description|
|--- | ---|
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text|

As you can see, it can get really tedious to create huge tables with multiple rows and columns.
One easy tip would be to organize data first in a spreadsheet or Google sheets. This will help visualize the structure and make it easier to transfer to Markdown. If a table is too large, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sections. 

If you're comfortable, use HTML code to create tables. 

An example of the above table using HTML:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Header</td>
    <td>Title</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Paragraph</td>
    <td>Text</td>
  </tr>
</table>

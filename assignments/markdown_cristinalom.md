# Advantages and Disadvantages of Markdown
## Advantages
**Versatility in Tagging:**
For instance, you can use a variety of tags to indicate that you want a bold string. I am familiar with the `strong` tag to get bold, but was unfamiliar I could also use the `**` tag to accomplish the same tag.  

<strong>Simplicity:</strong>
Relative to other documentation languages, like HTML and XML, the formatting is extremely straightforward. Markdown reminds me of rich text format, for example:
- To create italics you can use the `em` tag
- I suspect you can also use the `h1` tag for headings
- The `p` tag for paragraphs

  
## Disadvantages
<strong>Spelling and Grammar:</strong>
There is no spelling or grammar checker native to this application. It is more apparent while you are writing that you need to go over your work extra carefully to ensure that you did not create any typos or use the wrong verb tense.

<strong>Opportunities for Re-Use in Content:</strong>
If we want to reuse content from one markdown file to another, it does not seem like there is a way to do that. If I had the same codeblock as an example for a bunch of different files, would I have to manually change all of the files?

<strong>Unneccesary Syntax:</strong>
Perhaps a less serious issue, but I find that there is no need for tags to indicate small text, text color change, or buttons with emojis :roll_eyes:. I can think of like 10 tags that I would rather have than the text color change one for example, a tag for optional steps. The mathematical expressions formatting is neat though.

<strong>Tables:</strong> Why oh why do we have to manually format tables with these line things `|`?
| Manually   | Typed      | Heading      |
| ---------- | :--------- | :----------: |
| cell       | cell       | cell         |
| cell       | cell       | cell         |

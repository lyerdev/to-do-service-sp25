## Advantages

Some of the advantages of markdown include the following features:
* Fast and easy way to create content
* Lots of free support

### Content

Relative to other markup languages like HTML, markdown utilizes plain text formatting, so creating content is much closer to regular writing. Specifying formatting changes is also low-impact to the legibility of the text. For instance, the following table compares some common formatting features that are more cumbersome to read in HTML rather than markdown.

| Topic | Markdown | HTML |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unordered list | `* list item 1` | `<ul><li>list item 1</li></ul>` |
| Code block | ` ```code``` ` | `<div><pre>code</pre></div>` |

### Free Support

Markdown also comes with plenty of support from free sources. The following links demonstrate some free resources:

## Disadvantages

One disadvantage of markdown is the limited formatting capabilities. While the styling features cover a large portion of typical styling needs, it does not offer nearly as much customization as other markup languages or desktop publishing tools.
